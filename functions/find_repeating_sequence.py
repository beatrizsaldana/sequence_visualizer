'''
Script to find repreating sequence in list of numbers.
Assumption: sequence consists ONLY of repeating sequences.
For example...
    if input = 1,2,3,1,2,3
    output = 1,2,3

    if input = 1,1,1,2,3,1,2,3
    output = None

    if input = [1,2,3,1,2,3,1]
    output = [1, 2, 3]

The script will validate that the ENTIRE input sequence
consists of the same repeating sequence.

Worst case scenario runtime:
n = sequence length
loop through entire sequence
loop through sequence but in sequence/repeating_sequence chuncks
O(2n)

    This function will be called when a sequence can be

        The first iteration of the while loop will start at
